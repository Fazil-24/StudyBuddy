# StudyBuddy
AI companion to assist your UPSC Prep

The idea behind my app is to provide a comprehensive, interactive platform to support UPSC aspirants in their preparation. The app uses a conversational interface, paired with cutting-edge generative AI, to help users learn efficiently and effectively.

There are three major features of the app that provide real value:

Conversational Interface with Gemini 2.0 and RAG
The heart of the app is the interactive chatbot, where users can ask questions based on the topic they are currently learning. Powered by the Gemini 2.0 model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system can pull information from a large corpus of UPSC-related material and generate accurate, context-aware answers.

Grounded Google Search for Up-to-Date Information
To ensure that users stay informed, I’ve integrated a Google search feature that fetches the latest news and updates relevant to the user’s selected topic. Whether it’s current affairs, new policies, or global events, users are always in the loop with what’s happening around their studies.

Sample Questions for Exam Practice
The app also includes a section where users can explore potential exam questions. Whether it’s understanding question types or revisiting previous year’s papers, this feature helps users better prepare for the real exam environment.

To replicate this solution in your system, follow the steps:
1. Clone the GitHub repo in your system.
2. Pip install the requirements.txt file.
3. Obtain the API key from Google AI Studio and Insert the API key in the .env file
4. Finally, run "Python app.py" in your IDE to run it locally.
