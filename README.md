# StudyBuddy
Last Sunday, I caught up with a friend who had just returned from his hometown. He shared that he’s preparing for the UPSC exam, aiming for a career in civil services. As we talked, 80% of the conversation revolved around how challenging the exam is — especially with its vast syllabus and increasing competition every year.

He spoke about the struggles of managing such a wide range of learning content, spanning history, geography, environment, and current affairs. He has a dozen books for each subject and finds it overwhelming to constantly refer to multiple sources for the same topics. At one point, he wished aloud how much easier it would be if all the material could be consolidated in one place.

That’s when a light bulb went off in my mind — this could be the perfect use case for generative AI. When I received the confirmation for the build and blog marathon, I was excited and had a perfect opportunity to implement this project.

The Solution — StudyBuddy: A Smart UPSC Preparation Companion
So, what does this solution look like? The idea behind my app is to provide a comprehensive, interactive platform to support UPSC aspirants in their preparation. The app uses a conversational interface, paired with cutting-edge generative AI, to help users learn efficiently and effectively.

There are three major features of the app that provide real value:

Conversational Interface with Gemini 2.0 and RAG
The heart of the app is the interactive chatbot, where users can ask questions based on the topic they are currently learning. Powered by the Gemini 2.0 model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), the system can pull information from a large corpus of UPSC-related material and generate accurate, context-aware answers.
Grounded Google Search for Up-to-Date Information
To ensure that users stay informed, I’ve integrated a Google search feature that fetches the latest news and updates relevant to the user’s selected topic. Whether it’s current affairs, new policies, or global events, users are always in the loop with what’s happening around their studies.
Sample Questions for Exam Practice
The app also includes a section where users can explore potential exam questions. Whether it’s understanding question types or revisiting previous year’s papers, this feature helps users better prepare for the real exam environment.

To replicate this solution in your system, follow the steps:

Clone the GitHub repo https://github.com/Fazil-24/StudyBuddy in your system.
Pip install the requirements.txt file.
Obtain the API key from Google AI Studio and Insert the API key in the .env file
Finally, run “python app.py” in your IDE to run it locally.
Why Google’s Tech Stack?
Building this solution wouldn’t have been possible without leveraging some powerful tools from Google’s tech stack. Here’s how they played a crucial role:

Gemini 2.0: The latest version of Google’s generative AI model is the backbone of the app, offering advanced capabilities for in-context retrieval and natural language generation.
Google Cloud Storage: Used to securely store and organize the large corpus of UPSC preparation materials, making them easily accessible for retrieval during chatbot interactions.
BigQuery: Experimented with RAG using BigQuery to manage and query the structured data efficiently, enabling smooth interaction between the user’s queries and the data.
Key Takeaways
Explored and stress-tested the Gemini 2.0 model with a vast corpus of data.
Learned how to integrate the grounding feature through Google search for the latest updates.
Gained hands-on experience with different databases such as BigQuery and FireStore etc and learned how to connect them with the application to store and retrieve relevant data.
What’s Next?
While the app is already useful, I’m not stopping here. The next step is to evaluate essays written by users and provide constructive feedback. I’m working on implementing a feedback system where the app can analyze essays and offer tips on improving structure, content, and presentation.

As I continue to refine the app, I plan to add more features, such as personalized study plans, more practice questions, and deeper integration of real-time data. The goal is to create a one-stop solution that empowers UPSC aspirants to study smarter, not harder.

I’d love to hear your thoughts and feedback on this project as I continue to enhance and improve it. Stay tuned for more updates!
